/**
 * This module provides the parent interfaces for most of the 
 * widgets considered 'controls'.
 *
 * Controls allow users to manipulate the state of an application
 * by interacting with widgets on screen. In simpler terms,
 * they are the widgets that accept user input or trigger 
 * reactions when the user manipulates them.
 *
 * Generally, we use a streaming based workflow, that is
 * as the user preforms a supported action and event is generated
 * each and every time and some handler is applied to the event.
